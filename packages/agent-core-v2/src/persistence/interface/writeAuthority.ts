/**
 * `persistence/interface` — session-scoped write fencing contract.
 *
 * Defines `ISessionWriteAuthority`, the per-session lease proof that a Store
 * write must re-verify immediately before its bytes hit storage (design:
 * `.tmp/refactor-watch-design-v2.md` §3.4.2/§3.4.5 — the pre-commit lease
 * re-read is the hard gate and must fail closed), and the App-scoped
 * `IWriteAuthorityRegistry` the `AppendLogStore` resolves authorities through.
 * The registry never creates semantics of its own: it only maps `sessionId`
 * to the authority the session lifecycle registered, so a write for a
 * session with no registered authority is a bypass attempt and must be
 * rejected. `sessionIdFromScope` keeps the filesystem-layout knowledge
 * (`sessions/<wsId>/<sessionId>[/agents/<agentId>]`) in exactly one place;
 * the root scope (`''`, e.g. `session_index.jsonl`) and any scope outside
 * the sessions tree deliberately carry no authority and pass untouched.
 * The concrete registry lives in
 * `persistence/backends/node-fs/writeAuthorityRegistryService.ts`.
