// src/lockfile.ts
//
// A small exclusive file lock using atomic tmp+link creation, aligned with the
// repo's unified cross-process lock protocol (pid-only directory-lock mode —
// see agent-core-v2's `interface/crossProcessLock.ts`; the protocol is an
// on-disk contract, so this package inlines its own zero-dependency
// implementation).
//
// Invariants:
// - Token-guarded: every acquire writes a unique `lock_id`; the token is
//   compared after every winning create (read-back), on every settle
//   re-check, and before release/releaseSync unlink — a late operation never
//   deletes or mistakes a newer holder's lock.
// - A lock whose owner PID is alive is never taken over. Stale = dead PID, a
//   reused PID (processStartedAt identity mismatch), a payload without a
//   usable PID, or an empty/unparseable file older than the creation window
//   (a fresh one is "creating" → held; foreign publishers are not required to
//   write atomically — our own publishes are atomic tmp+link).
// - Takeover quarantines the corpse via rename to `db.lock.stale.<lock_id>`
//   (never delete+create, so a frozen creator resuming mid-window cannot be
//   clobbered and the takeover stays auditable), then re-creates via the
//   atomic link. A full re-inspect precedes every rename attempt so a live
//   winner is never quarantined.
// - Exactly one holder is a construction, not a timing bet: every contender
//   registers a liveness watch covering its whole attempt, and every creator
//   — direct or takeover — settles (adaptive backoff) until no live foreign
//   watch remains before claiming, so an in-flight co-racer always resolves
//   first.
//
// The correctness backstop is dead-PID takeover plus the token guard against
// deleting someone else's lock. The beforeExit hook is only a safety net (it
// never fires on SIGKILL) — the README documents takeover on dead PID as the
// recovery path.
