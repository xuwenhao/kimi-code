 * (App level), the session facade, the error model, the event merging
 * helpers, the resume-replay builders, and the core-owned types (which also
 * re-export the v2 names used in public signatures). Additional v2 type
 * re-exports are added as Task 6-8 compile feedback demands them, not
 * preemptively.
