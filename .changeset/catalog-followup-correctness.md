Fix a set of small correctness issues on top of the catalog metadata work: configured efforts (config or the KIMI_MODEL_THINKING_EFFORT env override) are now normalized instead of being sent upstream as invalid values; a model's declared input limit can no longer exceed its effective context window, and the clamp now copies the record instead of mutating the user's config in place; context-usage percentages share one denominator (the effective input cap) across status endpoints, clamped to 1 where the wire schema bounds it while event streams keep the documented raw overflow signal; a provider-observed smaller context window now actually wins over the catalog's declared input cap during overflow recovery; per-model endpoints declared with an unrecognized override SDK are preserved via the OpenAI-compatible fallback, while known proprietary SDKs stay refused; and the model inspector attributes input-limit fields to their actual config, override, or clamp provenance.
